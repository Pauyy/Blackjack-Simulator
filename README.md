# Blackjack Simulator
A small program that simulates a blackjack table.  
It takes care of the bare minimum and can be used as a basis for a wrapper.  
The [Protocol](Protocol.md) is documented.  
It is still in an early stage and a lot of stuff is missing.  

## Missing Stuff
No split  
No automatic reshuffling the deck  
No mention of a bust before showdown  

## Build
compile with `g++`
